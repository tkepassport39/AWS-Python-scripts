## AWS Python Scripts

A list of custom built python scripts to help with some AWS actions. You can run these scripts locally on your machine. 

You need to make sure you have AWS CLI installed and setup your ``` aws config ```. The python script boto3 module will access the settings from your aws config to perform the actions.
